  "The safety kernel's executable spec, three ways:

  1. battery lock — the kernel's own in-subset battery must pass
     case-for-case (`battery-case-count` == `(battery-pass-count)`),
     so a silently dropped case can't survive review.
  2. parity matrix — the kernel's phase core is compared against an
     independent reference copy of the ORIGINAL set-based cond logic
     over the FULL input space (all phases incl. out-of-range, all op
     codes incl. the reserved-read 0 and unknown 6, all governor
     dispositions). The façade delegates, so this is the guard that
     delegation didn't change semantics.
  3. governor boundary — the confidence floor boundary and the
     fail-closed treatment of out-of-range confidence, exercised
     through the real `banking.governor/check` façade."
